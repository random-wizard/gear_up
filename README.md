# gear_up

Mod for minetest to allow character to equip items; jewelry, armor, outfits, etc... Also has a basic crate system to allow loot boxes to appear in different block types and depths; ice crates, sand crates, deep stone crates, etc...

Code hacked together from mod equippable accessories. https://content.minetest.net/packages/davidthecreator/equippable_accessories/
